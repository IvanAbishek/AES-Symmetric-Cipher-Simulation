# AES-Symmetric-Cipher-Simulation
Built a Python client-server project demonstrating secure communication using AES symmetric encryption. The server generates a key, the client encrypts messages, and the server decrypts them. Learned socket programming, key handling, padding, and secure data transfer. First practical step into cybersecurity and cryptography basics project
